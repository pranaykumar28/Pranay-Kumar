### Problem Statement
###### For any video YouTube provides some data metrices such as Views, Likes, Comments, Shares, etc available publically. Based on these data metrices one has to predict the ad views i.e. views earned through advertizements. External library or any dataset can be used for the prediction.

### Submission
###### Entire algorithm alongwith the text file is required. Test file should be in *.csv* file and in inline below format:
| vid_id | ad_view |
|--------|---------|
| VID_1  |    1    |

### Evaluation
###### Here is the formula based on which calculation will be made: 
| Test score + Algorithm |
| ------------------------------ |
